# <pre align="center">Vector Sorting - Enhanced</pre>

## <pre align="center">Application Purpose</pre>

This application loads bid data from a CSV file and gives the user the option to sort those bids by a parameter such as amount of bid ID. Initially there was only quickSort and selectionSort, which sort by title and bid ID.
The user now also has the ability to add a bid to the vector by inputting the proper attributes. 

## Project Build

This is an application built using C++ which uses vectors and structures to upload and sort bids from a CSV file. This application uses built in sort algorithms and shows time complexity on each sort. I reused getBid function that wasnâ€™t used to get one bid from the user to input it into the vector.

## Future Plans

It would be nice to implement other data structures into this application such as heaps and arrays.
Another nice thing to do is using a login system for a user to login and see their own bids.
Adding a GUI that looks better than the terminal is also a project for the future of this application.
