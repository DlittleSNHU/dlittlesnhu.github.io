Hello, my name is Daniel. I am living in Los Angeles, I own a digital marketing business, and I have been pursuing my degree in Computer Science here at Southern New Hampshire University for a few years now. I am currently 23, and as my program is coming to an end I am proud to say I have learned an abundant amount of skills usable in the industry. Technical skills I have learned are how to code in Python, Java, and C++, how to work with database management systems such as MongoDB and SQL, and how to work with data structures and algorithms within code. Some classes I really look back at are 1. My CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms class, as it really taught me about time complexity and sorting algorithms 2. My CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project class, since we dove into team environments and how to comment out changes within the code and push them to git repositories 3. IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, because I learned how to work with classes and how to create object oriented projects. Aside from these courses, my CS-330 course dove into software engineering techniques a lot more in working with OpenGL. I also took a few cyber security courses which helped my mindset on security very much.
Practical skills I learned were not giving up on a project once it was started, planning ahead before starting a new project, and learning from mistakes to then apply them to future projects.
